Foundry Publish is a CLI tool that developers can use to publish new versions of
their packages for [Foundry Virtual Tabletop] via the [Package Release API].

## Usage

You can run Foundry Publish with `npx`:

```
npx @ghost-fvtt/foundry-publish [options]
```

Alternatively you can install it globally and then execute it:

```
npm install -g @ghost-fvtt/foundry-publish
foundry-publish [options]
```

### Options

In order to use Foundry Publish, you need to provide several parameters. They
can be provided either as environment variables or as command line options, with
one exception: For security reasons, the token required to access the
[Package Release API] can _only_ be provided as environment variable.
Additionally, a couple of options can also be read from a manifest file.
